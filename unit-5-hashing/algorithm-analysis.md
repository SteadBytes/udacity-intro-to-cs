# Algorithm Analysis
### Procedure:
Well defined sequence of steps that can be executed *mechanically* - no 'thought required' to execute.

### Algorithm:
A procedure that is guaranteed to **always finish** and produce **correct result**.

## Cost
Different algorithms may be better for different inputs - usually size of input (type can sometimes be a factor too)
* **Time** - Running computers requires money, the faster an algorithm, the less money spent running it.
* **Memory** - The memory requirements of an algorithm will affect the size, power and therefore cost of the computer required. 

Both time and memory are easily seen as cost factors when using **cloud services**. The more CPU time used, the more you are charged. The more storage/memory you require, the more you are charged.
